# Python Minigames

This repository contains a collection of three Python-based minigames with a main hub/game selector. Each game is a simple yet fun project designed to showcase basic Python programming concepts.

## Requirements

To run these minigames, you will need a Python interpreter installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The Snake and Fruit game was updated where the sound effect could be used on Mac and Linux. It still uses Winsound for Windows, which is built into Python. 

The Fruit Catcher game also uses the `pygame` library for graphics and game mechanics.

**Minimum version required**: Python 3.x

**Additional dependencies**:
- For the Fruit Catcher game:
  - Install `pygame` by running:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
