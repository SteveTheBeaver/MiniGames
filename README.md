# Python Minigames

This repository contains a collection of three Python-based minigames with a main hub/game selector. Each game is a simple yet fun project designed to showcase basic Python programming concepts.

## Requirements

To run these minigames, you will need a Python interpreter installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

The Snake and Fruit Catcher games use the `winsound` module (which is built into Python on Windows, and intended for Windows devices) for sound effects, and the Fruit Catcher game also uses the `pygame` library for graphics and game mechanics.

**Minimum version required**: Python 3.x

**Additional dependencies**:
- For the Fruit Catcher game:
  - Install `pygame` by running:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SteveTheBeaver/MiniGames.git
